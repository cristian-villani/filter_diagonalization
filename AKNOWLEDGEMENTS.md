# Acknowledgments

This project is dedicated to my PhD supervisor, **Prof. Francesco Tarantelli**,
who introduced me to the world of Unix computer systems and
software developement after having influenced me deeply with his enthusiasm
for theoretical chemistry.
It was more than twenty years ago that I had the privilege to share the
same room with him at the University of Perugia.

I would also like to thank **Prof. Robin Santra** for suggesting me to use
filter diagonalization to get selected eigenvalues for very
large matrices. I will always fondly remember
the time spent in Heidelberg at the research group of **Prof. Lorenz Cederbaum**
where I could work together with so many great scientists.

## Libraries and Tools

- **LAPACK**: This project uses LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) for performing high-performance linear algebra computations, such as matrix factorizations and eigenvalue problems.

- **BLAS**: The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) library is used for optimized basic vector and matrix operations. LAPACK depends on BLAS for low-level linear algebra routines.
